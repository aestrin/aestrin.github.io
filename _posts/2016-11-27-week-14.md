<h2>What did I do this week?</h2>

This past week was a short one in terms of work done for class. I started the extra credit assignment before I went back home for the holiday. I could solve the problem for the two example cases, however, when I uploaded the solution to the tester I received a wrong answer result. I did not have time to consider the problem yet, but I plan to fix it this week. Other than that, I spent the rest of the week in New York with my family and friends for the holiday. 

<h2>What is standing in my way?</h2>

Currently I am beginning my hell week of exams. I have already started to study for my Algo exam over break, and I am hoping to feel comfortable with the material by the end of Monday at the latest. I am somewhat confident that I will be able to prepare for all of my exams before Thursday, but I will make a final call on whether or not I should move an exam by this evening. 

<h2>What will I do next week?</h2>

This week I will be studying and finishing up the extra credit assignment. Once Thursday night is over I am technically finished for the semester. I am excited to be done after a long past few weeks. After my exams are over I am going to get back to work on a few side projects of mine and relax in Austin with friends for about two weeks before I head home for the break.

<h2>Tip of the week:</h2>

To anyone who is considering taking this class my tip is do it. Overall the class has been a rewarding experience and professor Downing gives fantastic lectures. In comparison to other professors I have had in the department he can keep the class engaged and interested in the lecture. Originally I thought his lack of slides was a downside, but by almost holding a conversation with the class rather than reading from a slide deck he could keep me interested. And on top of all of that his humor adds to the general entertainment of the lecture.
